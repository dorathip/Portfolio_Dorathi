                    Greetings! I am Dorathi Paranjothi, a passionate <b>Full Stack Developer</b>
                    With a deep-rooted love for technology and a knack for staying ahead of the curve, 
                    I am dedicated to shaping the future of Web through innovative solutions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a Full Stack Developer, I have honed my skills in Java, Angular, React, Spring Boot,
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, MongoDB, REST, XML, JSON, Apigee, 
                    AWS Lambda, Planisware, GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, Jira and Kanban. I have developed 
                    Wholesale APIs and Ecommerce websites. I have worked in Healthcare and Health Insurance 
                    projects as well and consistently exceeded expectations in delivering results.
                    
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With a keen eye for detail and a strong focus on quality, 
                    I strive to deliver efficient and scalable solutions that meet the 
                    unique challenges of the Web industry. I collaborate closely 
                    with cross-functional teams, and IT professionals, to ensure seamless integration and 
                    interoperability across systems, ultimately improving delivery.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I am very much interested in integrating APIs 
                    using Apigee as <em>REST</em> & <em>HTTP</em>. 
                    These standards play a crucial role in enabling seamless and interoperable
                    exchange of information, ensuring that data can be shared 
                    securely and efficiently across different systems and platforms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an avid enthusiast of technology. 
                    I constantly immerse myself in the ever-evolving world of tech, keeping 
                    up-to-date with the latest advancements and trends. You can often find 
                    me surfing the net for the latest tech updates, exploring cutting-edge
                    innovations, and staying abreast of the transformative potential of 
                    emerging technologies.

                    Outside of work, I find solace in the simple pleasures of life. 
                    Taking long walks allows me to unwind and gain fresh perspectives. 
                    Music has always been a companion in my journey, providing inspiration 
                    and a sense of tranquility. Additionally, I am an ardent follower of news
                    and current events, as I believe that staying informed about global 
                    developments is crucial in understanding the world around us.
